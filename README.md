# Uni-stuff
Things I did at Uni, like assignments, homework, workshops...
Each module has it's own folder and they are very different
### Data base systems
This module is all about SQL, Databases and things related to that.
It will contain a pdf with SQL statements graphs and other things.
### HCI
This module I think is about UI but I am not actually sure.
It will contain a .NET program I made in C# using Visual Studio.
### Linux
This module is about the linux command line and Bash scripting.
It will contain pdfs with some cmd commands and also scripts written in bash
### Progarmming
This module is about Java.
This folder will contain small projects and programs written in Java. I would reccomend looking at Libary (the biggest project/assignment)
